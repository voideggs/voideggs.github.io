        <p>With algae, daphnia, bacteria, grass, and fish, you may create your own little slow-moving ecosystem as a mighty pixel-laying supervisor. Every day, the sun will rise and set, causing the little world to come to life. Every component is important. The cycle is beautiful to see, especially in rapid-fire.Imagine if everything you do in the simulation has an impact on other universes, with all the moral and emotional ramifications that implies. This is a fun way to think about such issues.</p>

        <h2>Week 2</h2>

        <h3>Question 1. Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail.</h3>

        <p>Within my two-minute experience these were the things in my</p>

            <p>Instructions describing how I can make an ecosystem for fishes and goldfishes.</p>
            <p>Instructions detail that that I can put in Water and Sand to create an environment.</p>
            <p>Delphina and Algae was also recommended to see the reactions from the fishes.</p>
            <p>I drew some Stone on top of the sand in patches.</p>
            <p>I used the Wood to draw a tree on the left-hand side.</p>
            <p>I used Grass to drop on top of the tree.</p>
            <p>I drew Glass on top of the sand too.</p>
            <p>The hot bar of all the tools disappeared.</p>
            <p>I spread around Algae everywhere.</p>
            <p>I spammed a lot of Delphina.</p>
            <p>They hatched and became pink.</p>
            <p>The background was night-time, and they were glowing.</p>
            <p>I closed the browser.</p>
            <p>I opened it again.</p>
            <p>All my progress was there.</p>
        
        <h3>Question 2. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>

        <p>First thing that caught my attention was the empty orb in the centre on the screen. I also noticed that the orb would change colour from the background as it sets day and night cycling back and forth.</p>

        <h3>Question 3. What did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>

        <p>I spent the most time engaging with the all the different elements given on the taskbar on the side as I wanted to see what each one would do if I were to make them interact and if there was certain reacts to them</p>

        <h3>Question 4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>

        <p>The most common action for me was just watching what would happen after I put down the elements down. I wanted to see if Delphina would cause the Fishes to disappear or if I could attempt to create lava similar to the game Alchemy Lab.</p>

        <h3>Question 5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>

        <p>I believe the intended primary goal of this experience was to create an underwater living ecosystem of living creatures put into the game as suggested from the CO2 thermostat on the right-hand side by creating the perfect balance of a safe environment.</p>

        <h3>Question 6. How does the experience communicate it's primary goal?</h3>

        <p>I think the premise is really easy to pick up for people that have played sandbox games in the past such as Minecraft or Terraria given that the art style direction of the game is pixelated like those games. The controls are very straight forward and gives a lot of freedom to what the user would like to do with their environment given as there is no wrong or right way of approaching this game.</p>

        <h3>Question 7. What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?</h3>

        <p>From first impressions from the interactive website, its intended duration from the user would be around an hour or two as it engages them to discover what each element given in the game can do with one another. Since the game does continue your progress after closing the browser it can also be implied that the user can come back the next day to see what has happened to their orb overnight. However, I doubt this is the type of game that anyone would consistently play to progress and more of an AFK game to have on the side.</p>

        <h2>Week 3</h2>

        <h3>Question 8. What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference?</h3>

        <p>The metaphor from this website experience is evolution. As time passes with the elements you place inside the orb the more things around the orb changes or develops into something else. Itâ€™s a reflection with the real world as over time everything evolves slowly as time passes by. Additionally, it can be referenced that all of us are fishes in orbs with no control of the world and we learn to adapt the orb with its changes. </p>

        <h3>Question 9. What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it?</h3>

        <p>As a viewer for the experience, we are meant to feel powerful at the start where we have full control and freedom to our environment making it anything and everything. However, as we progress over the in-game days we begin to just sit back and observe our creation we just made as gratification to our work. The audience then is supposed to just monitor their work every now and then to make sure everything is in order, and nothing goes wrong with it.</p>

        <h3> Question 10. What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?</h3>

        <p>The most frustrating element from the interaction is the limitations of the interactions such as everything being one orb but also the tools supplied is not enough to create a varied ecosystem. The website clearly aims you to create a fish tank for aquatic animals which would be more interesting to mix more elements together to create crossbreed species. </p>

        <h3>Question 11. What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you?</h3>

        <p>The most satisfying element for me was seeing the changes that happen over the days as you can see the background changing hues to indicate how it becomes day and night. It was also seeing how fishes would evolve to become bigger or disappear as time changes as I wanted to see what would happen if I mixed certain things together.</p>
